Banners are tall colorful decorative blocks. They can be placed on the floor and at walls. Banners can be emblazoned with a variety of patterns using a lot of dye in crafting.=
Use crafting to draw a pattern on top of the banner. Emblazoned banners can be emblazoned again to combine various patterns. You can draw up to 12 layers on a banner that way. If the banner includes a gradient, only 3 layers are possible.=
You can copy the pattern of a banner by placing two banners of the same color in the crafting gridâ€”one needs to be emblazoned, the other one must be clean. Finally, you can use a banner on a cauldron with water to wash off its top-most layer.=
